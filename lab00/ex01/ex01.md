Exercise 01
-----------


A first file stores a text with an undefined number of rows.
Each row is shorter than 100 characters.
A second file stores a list of words.
Each word is shorter than 20 characters, and the number of words
is at most equal to 100.


Write a program that counts the number of times each word stored in the
second file appears in the text stored in the first file.


Once the file has been read, the program has to print out (on the standard
output) each word with its absolute frequency, i.e., the number of
times it appears in the text.


Both files have to be read just once.
Capital and small letters have to be considered as equivalent, e.g.,
"word" and "WORD" and "WoRd" are considered as equivalent.


Example
-------


Let the first file be the following one:


Watch your thoughts ; they become words .
Watch your words ; they become actions .
Watch your actions ; they become habits .
Watch your habits ; they become character .
Watch your character ; it becomes your destiny .
Lao-Tze


and the second file the following one:


watch
words
become


The program has to print-out:


watch - 5 occurrence(s)
words - 2 occurrence(s)
become - 4 occurrence(s)


Observation
-----------


The number of words in the second file is unknown.
Which are the options that we have to define the data structure storing them?
Notice that several more options are going to be introduced during the course.
